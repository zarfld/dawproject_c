## Critical Issues üî¥

### FR-FILE-003: Support Streaming Access for Large Projects
**Issue**: Missing traceability to specific user story  
**Impact**: Requirement not testable through user scenarios  
**ISO 29148 Reference**: ¬ß 6.4.6 (Traceability)  
**Fix**: Create user story US-003 for streaming access or link to existing story

### NFR-USABILITY-001: API Learning Curve  
**Issue**: Subjective acceptance criteria "basic C++ knowledge" and "one day of learning"  
**Impact**: Cannot verify compliance objectively  
**ISO 29148 Reference**: ¬ß 6.4.4 (Correctness), ¬ß 6.4.7 (Measurability)  
**Fix**: Define specific measurable criteria:
- "Complete tutorial exercises 1-5 within 4 hours"
- "Successfully integrate into sample application within 8 hours"
- "Score ‚â•80% on API comprehension test"

---

## Warnings üü°

### STR-BUS-001: Cross-DAW Project Exchange Enablement
**Issue**: Success criteria includes subjective timeline "within 12 months"  
**Impact**: External dependencies make verification uncertain  
**ISO 29148 Reference**: ¬ß 6.4.5 (Testability)  
**Fix**: Add measurable internal criteria focusing on library capabilities rather than adoption

### Missing System Requirements Specification  
**Issue**: No comprehensive system requirements document linking all functional/non-functional requirements  
**Impact**: Difficult to ensure complete coverage of stakeholder needs  
**ISO 29148 Reference**: ¬ß 6.4.2 (Completeness)  
**Fix**: Create `02-requirements/system-requirements-spec.md` following template

- Rationale provided for all requirements
- Dependencies and risks documented

‚ö†Ô∏è **GAPS**:
- Missing system boundary definition
- Incomplete interface specifications (need API specification document)
- Missing requirements for error logging and diagnostics
- No requirements for configuration or settings management

### 2. Consistency Analysis (ISO 29148:2018 ¬ß 6.4.3)

‚úÖ **STRENGTHS**:
- Consistent use of "shall" for mandatory requirements
- Consistent ID format: STR-XXX-001, FR-XXX-001, NFR-XXX-001

**EXAMPLE OF EXCELLENT TESTABILITY**:
```gherkin
Scenario: Load standard DAW Project file
  Given a valid DAW Project file created by Bitwig Studio
  When the system loads the file using the primary API
  Then all project metadata is accessible (title, artist, tempo)
  And all track structure is preserved (names, routing, effects)
```

- Clear forward traceability planned (requirement ‚Üí design ‚Üí code ‚Üí test)
- User stories properly linked to functional requirements

‚ö†Ô∏è **TRACEABILITY GAPS**:
- FR-FILE-003 references "US-003" which doesn't exist
- Some stakeholder requirements not yet linked to system requirements
- Incomplete traceability matrix

‚úÖ **EXCELLENT MEASURABILITY** (Non-Functional Requirements):
- Performance: "‚â§30 seconds for 32-track, 2-hour project"
- Memory: "<500MB peak memory usage"
- Thread safety: "Zero data races detected by ThreadSanitizer"

**MEASURABLE TARGET EXAMPLES**:
| Requirement | Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|-------------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| NFR-PERF-001 | Load time | ‚â§30 seconds | Automated timing with standard hardware |
| NFR-PERF-002 | Memory usage | <500MB peak | Memory profiling tools |
| NFR-THREAD-001 | Thread safety | Zero races | ThreadSanitizer analysis |

- **US-003**: Streaming access for large projects (for FR-FILE-003)
- **US-004**: Thread-safe concurrent access (for STR-FUNC-003)

### Orphan Requirements
