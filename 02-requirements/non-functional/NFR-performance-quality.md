# Non-Functional Requirements: Performance & Quality Attributes

## NFR-PERF-001: Large Project Loading Performance

**ID**: NFR-PERF-001  
**Category**: Performance  
**Priority**: High (P1)  
**Source**: STR-PERF-001 (Large Project Handling)

**Requirement**:  
The system shall load DAW Project files containing 32 tracks with 2 hours of audio content (48kHz/32bit) within 30 seconds on standard development hardware.

**Metric**: File loading time measurement from API call to data availability  
**Target**: ≤30 seconds for 32-track, 2-hour project on Intel i5, 16GB RAM  
**Test Method**: Automated performance testing with standardized project files

**Rationale**: Professional audio projects can be extremely large and complex. Users expect reasonable loading times even for substantial projects to maintain productive workflows.

**Dependencies**: Efficient XML parsing, optimized ZIP decompression, smart memory management  
**Risks**: Hardware variation, project complexity variation, background system load

## NFR-PERF-002: Memory Usage for Streaming Mode

**ID**: NFR-PERF-002  
**Category**: Performance / Resource Management  
**Priority**: High (P1)  
**Source**: STR-PERF-002 (Efficient Memory Management)

**Requirement**:  
The system shall process DAW Project files with 128+ tracks in streaming mode while maintaining memory usage below 500MB regardless of total project size.

**Metric**: Peak memory usage during streaming operations  
**Target**: <500MB peak memory usage for any project size in streaming mode  
**Test Method**: Memory profiling with Valgrind/AddressSanitizer during streaming operations

**Rationale**: Audio applications often run in resource-constrained environments. Streaming mode must provide predictable, bounded memory usage for large project processing.

**Dependencies**: Streaming XML parser, selective ZIP extraction, efficient buffer management  
**Risks**: Complex project structures, embedded file sizes, XML parser memory behavior

## NFR-THREAD-001: Thread Safety for Concurrent Access

**ID**: NFR-THREAD-001  
**Category**: Reliability / Concurrency  
**Priority**: Medium (P2)  
**Source**: STR-FUNC-003 (Thread-Safe Operations)

**Requirement**:  
The system shall support concurrent read operations from multiple threads accessing the same project data without data races or undefined behavior.

**Metric**: Thread safety validation through stress testing and static analysis  
**Target**: Zero data races detected by ThreadSanitizer, successful concurrent operations  
**Test Method**: Multi-threaded stress testing, static analysis with thread safety tools

**Rationale**: Modern audio applications are multi-threaded, often processing audio in real-time threads while UI threads access project data. Safe concurrent access is essential.

**Dependencies**: Thread-safe data structures, proper synchronization primitives, immutable data patterns  
**Risks**: Performance overhead from synchronization, potential deadlocks, complex lock hierarchies

## NFR-SECURITY-001: Input Validation and Bounds Checking

**ID**: NFR-SECURITY-001  
**Category**: Security / Reliability  
**Priority**: Medium (P2)  
**Source**: STR-SEC-001 (Input Validation and Sanitization)

**Requirement**:  
The system shall validate all input data and protect against buffer overflows, XML injection attacks, and ZIP bomb exploits when processing DAW Project files.

**Metric**: Security vulnerability scanning and penetration testing  
**Target**: Zero buffer overflows, no successful injection attacks, bounded resource consumption  
**Test Method**: Fuzzing with malformed files, security scanner analysis, manual penetration testing

**Rationale**: DAW Project files come from external sources and may be maliciously crafted. The library must protect host applications from security vulnerabilities.

**Dependencies**: Bounds-checked parsing, input sanitization, resource limits, secure coding practices  
**Risks**: Performance impact from validation overhead, false positive rejections of valid files

## NFR-USABILITY-001: API Learning Curve

**ID**: NFR-USABILITY-001  
**Category**: Usability / Developer Experience  
**Priority**: High (P1)  
**Source**: STR-USER-001 (Intuitive C++ API Design)

**Requirement**:  
The system API shall enable developers with basic C++ knowledge to implement common DAW Project operations (load, access tracks, save) within one day of learning.

**Metric**: Developer productivity study with representative tasks  
**Target**: 90% of developers complete basic integration tasks within 8 hours  
**Test Method**: User studies with C++ developers, task completion time measurement

**Rationale**: Library adoption depends on ease of use. Complex APIs create barriers to adoption and increase integration time and costs.

**Dependencies**: Clear documentation, intuitive naming, comprehensive examples, good error messages  
**Risks**: Subjective nature of "ease of use", varying developer experience levels

---

## NFR-COMPAT-001: Cross-Platform Consistency

**ID**: NFR-COMPAT-001  
**Category**: Portability / Compatibility  
**Priority**: High (P1)  
**Source**: Technology Constraints (Cross-Platform Requirement)

**Requirement**:  
The system shall provide identical functionality and behavior across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms with no platform-specific limitations or differences in output.

**Metric**: Cross-platform compatibility testing and output comparison  
**Target**: 100% functional parity, identical output files across platforms  
**Test Method**: Automated testing on all platforms, binary file comparison, behavioral verification

**Rationale**: Audio software developers target multiple platforms. Platform differences create support burden and limit library adoption.

**Dependencies**: Cross-platform build system (CMake), platform-neutral dependencies, consistent file handling  
**Risks**: Platform-specific behavior in dependencies, file system differences, floating-point variations

## NFR-MAINT-001: Code Coverage and Testability

**ID**: NFR-MAINT-001  
**Category**: Maintainability / Quality  
**Priority**: Medium (P2)  
**Source**: XP Practices (Test-Driven Development)

**Requirement**:  
The system implementation shall maintain minimum 90% code coverage through automated tests, with all public APIs covered by integration tests.

**Metric**: Code coverage analysis and test suite metrics  
**Target**: ≥90% line coverage, 100% public API coverage, <5% uncovered critical paths  
**Test Method**: Coverage analysis tools (gcov/lcov), automated coverage reporting in CI

**Rationale**: High test coverage reduces bugs, enables confident refactoring, and provides documentation through tests. XP practices emphasize test-first development.

**Dependencies**: TDD implementation approach, comprehensive test framework, CI/CD integration  
**Risks**: Test maintenance overhead, false confidence from coverage metrics, difficult-to-test code paths

## NFR-BUILD-001: Build Time Performance

**ID**: NFR-BUILD-001  
**Category**: Development Efficiency  
**Priority**: Low (P3)  
**Source**: Development Process Requirements

**Requirement**:  
The system shall complete full build (including tests) in under 5 minutes on standard development hardware to support rapid iteration.

**Metric**: Build time measurement from clean state to completion  
**Target**: <5 minutes full build including all tests on Intel i5, 16GB RAM  
**Test Method**: Automated build time monitoring in CI/CD pipeline

**Rationale**: Fast build times support agile development practices and developer productivity. Long builds discourage frequent testing and integration.

**Dependencies**: Efficient build system configuration, parallel compilation, incremental builds  
**Risks**: Code growth increasing build time, complex dependency resolution, test execution time
