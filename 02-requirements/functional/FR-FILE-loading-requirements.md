# Functional Requirement: DAW Project File Loading

## FR-FILE-001: Load DAW Project File

**ID**: FR-FILE-001  
**Priority**: Critical (P0)  
**Source**: STR-FUNC-001 (Complete Read-Write Support)  
**Category**: Core API / File I/O  

**Description**:  
The system shall provide the capability to load DAW Project files (.dawproject) from the file system and parse all contained elements into accessible data structures, maintaining complete data integrity and standards compliance with the Bitwig DAW Project v1.0 specification.

**Rationale**:  
Loading DAW Project files is the fundamental capability required for any application supporting the format. The library must provide reliable, efficient loading that handles all valid project structures while providing clear error reporting for invalid files.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario: Load standard DAW Project file
  Given a valid DAW Project file created by Bitwig Studio
  When the system loads the file using the primary API
  Then all project metadata is accessible (title, artist, tempo)
  And all track structure is preserved (names, routing, effects)
  And all timeline content is available (clips, automation, markers)
  And all device information is retained (VST parameters, presets)
  And file loading completes within performance targets

Scenario: Load complex multi-track project
  Given a DAW Project file with 32 tracks and 2 hours of content
  When the system loads the file in DOM mode
  Then all tracks are accessible with correct properties
  And all audio and MIDI clips maintain timing accuracy
  And all automation curves are preserved with full resolution
  And memory usage remains within acceptable limits
  And loading time does not exceed 30 seconds

Scenario: Validate file format compliance
  Given a DAW Project file with all supported element types
  When the system loads and validates the file structure
  Then all XML elements conform to the DAW Project schema
  And all file references are correctly resolved
  And embedded audio files are accessible
  And plugin state files are properly linked
  And no data elements are silently ignored or lost
```

**Dependencies**: 
- XML parsing library integration (FR-XML-001)
- ZIP file handling capability (FR-ZIP-001)  
- Error handling framework (FR-ERR-001)
- Memory management system (NFR-MEM-001)

**Risks**: 
- **Schema Complexity** (High): DAW Project schema is complex with many optional elements
- **File Size Handling** (Medium): Large projects may cause memory pressure
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility** (Medium): File path handling differs across platforms

## FR-FILE-002: Handle Malformed DAW Project Files

**ID**: FR-FILE-002  
**Priority**: High (P1)  
**Source**: STR-USER-002 (Comprehensive Error Reporting)  
**Category**: Error Handling / Validation

**Description**:  
The system shall detect and report specific errors in malformed DAW Project files with actionable information for resolution, including file location details, error categories, and suggested fixes where possible.

**Rationale**:  
Real-world DAW Project files may be corrupted, incomplete, or created by applications with different interpretations of the standard. Robust error handling with detailed reporting is essential for debugging and user support.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario: Detect XML syntax errors
  Given a DAW Project file with malformed XML structure
  When the system attempts to load the file
  Then loading fails with XMLParseException
  And error message includes line and column numbers
  And error describes the specific XML syntax problem
  And suggested fix is provided (e.g., "check closing tags")

Scenario: Identify missing required elements
  Given a DAW Project file missing mandatory schema elements
  When the system validates the project structure
  Then loading fails with SchemaValidationException
  And error identifies the specific missing element
  And error references the DAW Project standard section
  And location in file is provided where element should exist

Scenario: Report invalid file references
  Given a DAW Project file with broken audio file references
  When the system processes file references
  Then loading continues with warning (graceful degradation)
  And MissingFileException is logged with details
  And list of missing files is available to application
  And project structure remains accessible despite missing files
```

**Dependencies**:
- XML validation system (FR-XML-002)
- Logging and error reporting framework (FR-ERR-001)
- File reference resolution system (FR-REF-001)

**Risks**:
- **Performance Impact** (Low): Comprehensive validation may slow loading
- **False Positives** (Medium): Overly strict validation may reject valid files

## FR-FILE-003: Support Streaming Access for Large Projects

**ID**: FR-FILE-003  
**Priority**: High (P1)  
**Source**: STR-FUNC-002 (Dual Access Pattern Support)  
**Category**: Performance / Memory Management

**Description**:  
The system shall provide streaming access to DAW Project files that processes project elements sequentially without loading the complete project structure into memory, enabling handling of very large projects (128+ tracks) with bounded memory usage.

**Rationale**:  
Some use cases require analyzing or processing large DAW Project files without the memory overhead of loading everything into memory. Streaming access enables these scenarios while maintaining performance.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Scenario: Stream large project with bounded memory
  Given a DAW Project file with 128 tracks and complex automation
  When the system opens the file in streaming mode
  Then memory usage remains below 500MB regardless of project size
  And tracks can be processed sequentially
  And clip information is available as stream progresses
  And processing time scales linearly with project complexity

Scenario: Stream-based project analysis
  Given a large DAW Project file requiring metadata extraction
  When the system processes the file in streaming mode
  Then project metadata is available immediately
  And track count and basic info are accessible without full load
  And detailed track information is available on-demand
  And streaming can be interrupted and resumed

Scenario: Selective loading based on streaming analysis
  Given a complex project with many device types
  When the system streams through device information
  Then applications can selectively load only needed devices
  And unused plugin states are not loaded into memory
  And track filtering is possible based on content type
  And partial project reconstruction is supported
```

**Dependencies**:
- Streaming XML parser integration (FR-XML-003)
- Selective ZIP entry access (FR-ZIP-002)
- Iterator-based API design (FR-API-002)

**Risks**:
- **API Complexity** (High): Streaming API more complex than DOM approach
- **State Management** (Medium): Tracking streaming position and context
- **Random Access Loss** (Low): Some use cases require random access patterns
