## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Scenario: Save valid DAW Project file
  Given a project object with valid data
  When I call DawProject::save("my_project.dawproject")
  Then the file is created and contains all project data
  And the file can be loaded back with no data loss
  And saving completes within 30 seconds

Scenario: Handle unwritable file
  Given a project object and a read-only file path
  When I call DawProject::save("readonly.dawproject")
  Then a DawProjectException is thrown
  And the exception message clearly describes the problem
```
