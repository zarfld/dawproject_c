# User Story: Load DAW Project File

**US-001**: As a DAW developer, I want to load a DAW Project file with simple API calls, so that I can quickly implement DAW Project support in my application.

## Story Details

**As a** DAW developer  
**I want** to load a DAW Project file using a simple, intuitive API  
**So that** I can implement cross-DAW project compatibility without complex XML parsing

**Story Points**: 8  
**Priority**: Critical (P0)  
**Epic**: Core File Operations  
**Iteration**: 1

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Simple API**: Load project with single function call `DawProject::load("file.dawproject")`
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for malformed or missing files
- [ ] **Data Access**: All project elements accessible through object-oriented interface
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Automatic resource cleanup using RAII
- [ ] **Performance**: Load 32-track project within 30 seconds on standard hardware

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Scenario: Load valid DAW Project file
  Given a valid DAW Project file "test_project.dawproject" exists
  When I call auto project = DawProject::load("test_project.dawproject")
  Then the project object is successfully created
  And I can access project.getMetadata().getTitle()
  And I can iterate through project.getTracks()
  And all track names and properties are available
  And no memory leaks occur when project goes out of scope

Scenario: Handle malformed DAW Project file
  Given a malformed DAW Project file "broken.dawproject" exists
  When I call DawProject::load("broken.dawproject")
  Then a DawProjectException is thrown
  And the exception message clearly describes the problem
  And the exception includes file location of the error
  And no memory is leaked

Scenario: Handle missing file
  Given no file exists at "missing.dawproject"
  When I call DawProject::load("missing.dawproject")
  Then a FileNotFoundException is thrown
  And the exception message includes the file path
  And suggests checking file path and permissions
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] **Implementation**: Core loading functionality implemented with TDD
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for success and error cases
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Test with real DAW Project files from Bitwig repository
- [ ] **Documentation**: API documentation with usage examples
- [ ] **Code Review**: Code reviewed and meets project standards
- [ ] **Performance**: Meets performance targets in automated tests
- [ ] **Cross-Platform**: Tested on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Approach
- Use RAII for automatic resource management
- Implement exception-safe loading with proper cleanup
- Provide both throwing and non-throwing API variants
- Support both file path and stream-based loading

### Error Categories
1. **File System Errors**: Missing file, permission denied, disk full
2. **Format Errors**: Invalid ZIP structure, missing required files
3. **XML Errors**: Malformed XML, missing elements, schema violations
4. **Content Errors**: Invalid data values, missing dependencies

### Dependencies
- XML parsing library (pugixml or similar)
- ZIP handling library (minizip or similar)
- Exception handling framework
- Logging system for debugging

## Related Requirements

- **STR-FUNC-001**: Complete Read-Write Support
- **STR-USER-001**: Intuitive C++ API Design  
- **STR-USER-002**: Comprehensive Error Reporting
- **STR-PERF-001**: Large Project Handling

## Test Data

Use reference files from Bitwig DAW Project repository:
- Simple projects with basic tracks and clips
- Complex projects with multiple device types
- Edge cases with unusual but valid configurations
- Invalid files for error handling testing

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks  
**Risk Level**: Medium (XML parsing complexity)  
**Dependencies**: Phase 03 (Architecture) must define XML parsing strategy
