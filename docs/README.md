## üõ†Ô∏è Template Customization

### Adding Domain-Specific Guidance

Edit phase-specific `.github/copilot-instructions.md`:

```markdown
## Domain-Specific Patterns

### E-Commerce Domain

#### Order Processing
When working with orders, ensure:
- Order ID format: ORD-YYYYMMDD-XXXXX
- Orders have audit trail (who, when, what)
- Payment processing is idempotent
- Inventory is reserved atomically

#### Product Catalog
- SKU format: CAT-SUBCAT-XXXXX
- Product variants use parent-child relationship
- Price history maintained for auditing
```

### Adding New Templates

1. Create template in `../spec-kit-templates/`
2. Document template in README
3. Add `applyTo:` pattern in relevant phase
4. Test with Copilot
