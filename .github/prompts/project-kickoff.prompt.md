## STR-BUS-001: Revenue Growth Through Automation

**ID**: STR-BUS-001
**Priority**: High (P1)
**Source**: Business Sponsor (John Smith, VP Sales)
**Rationale**: Manual processes cost $50K/month; automation saves 80% effort

**Requirement**: 
The solution shall reduce manual order processing time by 80%, enabling the sales team to process 500 orders/day instead of current 100 orders/day.

**Success Criteria**:
- Order processing time reduced from 10 minutes to 2 minutes
- Sales team capacity increases from 100 to 500 orders/day
- Processing errors reduced from 5% to <1%
- ROI: Break-even within 6 months

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Scenario: Automated order processing
  Given sales team receives new order
  When order is submitted to system
  Then order processed within 2 minutes
  And confirmation sent to customer
  And sales team notified of completion
```

**Dependencies**: None
**Risks**: Team adoption (Medium), Integration complexity (High)
```

```

## 🎯 Sample Discovery Session

**Example conversation flow:**

### Discovery Questions:
```
Analyst: "What problem are you trying to solve?"

User: "Our customer support team spends 3 hours daily answering the same questions about order status. Customers get frustrated waiting for responses."

Analyst: "Who experiences this problem?"
User: "Customer support agents (5 people) and customers (500+ monthly support tickets)"

Analyst: "What happens if this problem isn't solved?"
User: "Support costs keep growing, customer satisfaction drops, agents burn out"

Analyst: "How is this currently handled?"
User: "Agents manually look up orders in 3 different systems, copy-paste info into emails"

...
```

### Generated Stakeholder Requirements:
```markdown
## STR-USER-001: Self-Service Order Status

**ID**: STR-USER-001
**Priority**: Critical (P0)
**Source**: Customer Support Manager (Sarah Johnson)
**Rationale**: 60% of support tickets are order status inquiries (preventable)

**Requirement**: 
Customers shall be able to check their order status, tracking info, and estimated delivery without contacting support.

**Success Criteria**:
- 80% reduction in "Where is my order?" support tickets
- Customer satisfaction score increase from 3.2 to 4.5
- Support team capacity freed for complex issues

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```gherkin
Scenario: Customer checks order status
  Given customer has order number "ORD-123456"  
  When customer enters order number and email on status page
  Then system displays current order status
  And system shows tracking number if shipped
  And system shows estimated delivery date
  And customer does not need to contact support
```
```

## 🔄 Next Steps Roadmap

After completing discovery, I'll provide a roadmap:

### Immediate (This Week):
1. ✅ **Stakeholder Requirements Complete** - Document created
2. ⏳ **Stakeholder Review** - Get approval from key stakeholders  
3. ⏳ **Requirements Baseline** - Version control, change management

### Phase 02 (Next 1-2 Weeks):
1. **System Requirements Analysis** - Use `requirements-elicit.prompt.md`
2. **Requirements Refinement** - Use `requirements-refine.prompt.md` 
3. **Completeness Check** - Use `requirements-complete.prompt.md`
4. **Requirements Validation** - Use `requirements-validate.prompt.md`

### Phase 03 (Following 2-3 Weeks):
1. **Architecture Design** - Use `architecture-starter.prompt.md`
2. **Architecture Decision Records** - Document key decisions
3. **C4 Diagrams** - Context, Container, Component views

### Quality Gates:
- **Phase 01 → 02**: All stakeholder requirements approved, no TBDs
- **Phase 02 → 03**: Requirements score ≥90% completeness, validated
- **Phase 03 → 04**: Architecture views complete, ADRs documented

## 🎓 Tips for Effective Discovery

### Do's:
✅ **Ask "Why" 5 times** - Get to root causes
✅ **Use specific examples** - "Show me how you do this today"
✅ **Quantify everything** - Numbers over adjectives ("fast" → "< 2 seconds")
✅ **Identify the unhappy paths** - What goes wrong?
✅ **Challenge assumptions** - "What if that assumption is wrong?"

### Don'ts:
❌ **Don't assume you understand** - Confirm with examples
❌ **Don't jump to solutions** - Focus on problems first
❌ **Don't skip constraints** - Budget, timeline, compliance matter
❌ **Don't forget edge cases** - What about power users? Mobile users?

## 🚀 Usage

### Starting a New Project:

```bash
# In VS Code with Copilot Chat
/project-kickoff.prompt.md I want to start a new project. 

Brief description: "We need a customer portal where users can track orders and download invoices."

# The prompt will then guide you through systematic discovery
```

### What You'll Get:

1. **Structured Interview** - Guided questions covering all aspects
2. **Stakeholder Requirements Spec** - Professional document following ISO 29148
3. **Project Structure** - Folders and initial files set up
4. **Next Steps Plan** - Clear roadmap for Phase 02
