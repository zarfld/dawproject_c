# ADR-005: Thread Safety Implementation

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Deciders**: Architecture Team  
**Technical Story**: Concurrency and Thread Safety for DAW Project C++ Library

---

## Context

The library must support concurrent access patterns:
- Multiple threads reading project data (UI, audio, analysis)
- Occasional writes (editing, automation, save)
- No data races or undefined behavior
- Predictable performance and deadlock avoidance
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Decision

We will implement thread safety using:
- **Reader-Writer Locks** (`std::shared_mutex`)
- **Immutable Data Structures** for read-mostly data
- **Copy-on-Write** for modifications
- **Atomic Operations** for counters and flags

## Rationale

- **Read-Mostly Workload**: Most operations are reads (project inspection, playback)
- **Performance**: Reader-writer locks allow many concurrent readers, single writer
- **Safety**: Immutable data prevents accidental modification
- **Simplicity**: Copy-on-write avoids complex locking for most use cases
- **Portability**: Uses C++17 standard library features

### Alternatives Considered
- **Coarse-Grained Mutex**: Simpler but blocks all threads, hurts performance
- **Fine-Grained Locking**: More scalable but complex, error-prone
- **Lock-Free Structures**: High complexity, not needed for this workload

## Implementation Strategy
- All public API entry points acquire appropriate lock
- Project data is immutable by default; modifications create new versions
- Use `std::shared_mutex` for project/model objects
- Use `std::atomic` for counters, flags
- Document thread safety guarantees in API docs
- Add static analysis and ThreadSanitizer to CI

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ High concurrency for read operations
- ✅ Simple, predictable locking model
- ✅ No data races or undefined behavior
- ✅ Cross-platform with standard C++

### Negative
- ⚠️ Write operations are more expensive (copy-on-write)
- ⚠️ Slight memory overhead for versioned data

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Deadlocks | Medium | Low | Careful lock ordering, avoid nested locks |
| Performance regression | Medium | Low | Benchmarking, profiling |
| API misuse | Medium | Medium | Document guarantees, static analysis |

## Compliance with Requirements
| Requirement | Thread Safety Support |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **NFR-THREAD-001 (Thread Safety)** | ✅ Reader-writer locks, atomic ops |
| **STR-FUNC-003 (Thread-Safe Ops)** | ✅ Immutable data, copy-on-write |
| **NFR-PERF-001 (Performance)** | ✅ High concurrency for reads |
