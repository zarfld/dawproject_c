# ADR-006: Memory Management Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Deciders**: Architecture Team  
**Technical Story**: Resource Management for DAW Project C++ Library

---

## Context

The library must:
- Handle large projects (32+ tracks, 2+ hours audio)
- Support both DOM (full in-memory) and streaming (bounded memory) modes
- Avoid memory leaks and resource exhaustion
- Be exception-safe and cross-platform
- Use modern C++ idioms (RAII, smart pointers)

## Decision

We will use:
- **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)** everywhere
- **Smart Pointers** (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`)
- **Custom Allocators** for streaming/large data
- **Memory Pools** for frequently allocated objects
- **Automatic Cleanup** on exceptions

## Rationale
- **RAII**: Ensures all resources are released automatically
- **Smart Pointers**: Prevent leaks, clarify ownership
- **Custom Allocators**: Limit memory usage in streaming mode
- **Memory Pools**: Reduce allocation overhead for small objects
- **Exception Safety**: All code paths clean up resources

### Alternatives Considered
- **Manual new/delete**: Error-prone, not exception-safe
- **Garbage Collection**: Not idiomatic in C++, adds overhead
- **Reference Counting Only**: Can create cycles, leaks

## Implementation Strategy
- All heap allocations via smart pointers
- Use `std::unique_ptr` for exclusive ownership, `std::shared_ptr` for shared
- Use custom allocators for DOM/streaming as needed
- Use memory pools for tracks, clips, events
- All file handles, buffers, and resources managed by RAII wrappers
- Add AddressSanitizer/Valgrind to CI

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ No memory leaks
- ✅ Predictable memory usage in streaming mode
- ✅ Exception safety
- ✅ High performance for frequent allocations

### Negative
- ⚠️ Slight learning curve for custom allocators
- ⚠️ Memory pools add complexity

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Memory leaks | High | Low | Smart pointers, static analysis |
| Fragmentation | Medium | Low | Pools, custom allocators |
| Overhead | Low | Low | Profile, optimize |

## Compliance with Requirements
| Requirement | Memory Management Support |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| **NFR-PERF-002 (Memory Usage)** | ✅ Streaming, custom allocators |
| **STR-PERF-002 (Efficient Memory)** | ✅ RAII, pools |
| **NFR-MAINT-001 (Testability)** | ✅ Leak detection, CI |
